# Introduction #
At minimum, you must specify the URL to the "root" of the CMS and the type of CMS being tested. The "root" is the base level URL where the CMS is installed. For example, with Wordpress the root level contains the wp-content/ and wp-admin/ directories, among others.

If you specify an incorrect root level, CMS explorer will continue to run but the results will not be as expected.


# Requirements #
  * PERL 5.x
  * Getopt::Long
  * [LibWhisker2](http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/lw.asp) (included)
  * [OSVDB API key](http://osvdb.org/api/about) (free for 100 queries per day)


# Installation #
  * Unpack archive
  * Create the file 'osvdb.key' in the cms-explorer directory, and put your OSVDB API key on the first line.
  * run ./cms-explorer.pl to ensure no errors are reported

# Examples #

Test for Wordpress plugins and themes against example.com, with low verbosity and explore for additional files. Route all "found" items using the bootstrap proxy running on port 8080 of localhost.

> `perl cms-explorer.pl -url http://example.com/ -v 1 -bsproxy localhost:8080 -explore -type wordpress`

Test for Wordpress themes on example.com using themelist.txt, with full verbosity and explore using the bootstrap proxy on port 80 of localhost.

> `perl cms-explorer.pl -url http://example.com/ -v 3 -bsproxy localhost -explore -themes -themefile themelist.txt -type wordpress`

Test for Drupal plugins/themes on example.com, with normal verbosity and no exploration.

> `perl cms-explorer.pl -url http://example.com/ -type drupal`

Test for Mambo (or Joomla) components/modules and templates, and search OSVDB.

> `perl wp-explorer.pl -url http://example.com/ -type joomla -osvdb`
